# Twitch-Views-Botter

Welcome to **Twitch-Views-Botter** ‚Äî the ultimate tool for *magically* boosting the viewer count of your favorite Twitch streamer (yup, it works... somehow... lmao).

## 1. Introduction

**Twitch-Views-Botter** is a simple Python tool designed to boost the viewer count of a selected Twitch stream. Think of it as a little nudge to help your favorite streamer feel a bit more popular ‚Äî or just to mess around and see how high you can go without Twitch noticing. üòÇ

## 2. Features

- **Boost Viewer Count**: Instantly adds viewers to the chosen Twitch stream.  
- **Proxy Power**: Leverages different proxy servers to simulate real viewers. (Pro tip: Only the first proxy server works reliably at the moment, so stick to it for now. The others are still "in training," lmao).
- **Multiple Tabs**: Opens multiple browser tabs to simulate a more "realistic" viewing experience.
- **Headless Operation**: Runs in a headless browser mode ‚Äî because who wants to see all those tabs popping up anyway?

## 3. How It Works (Somehow)

1. **Select Your Proxy Server**: Choose from a list of proxy servers. (Reminder: Only the first one works properly right now, the rest are just there for show. üòÇ)
2. **Enter Your Streamer**: Input the Twitch username of your chosen streamer who you want to give that sweet view count boost.
3. **Set the Viewer Count**: Decide how many "viewers" you want to join the party. Remember: the more, the merrier ‚Äî but also, the more unstable things can get. Use responsibly, or not... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4. **Watch the Magic Happen**: Sit back and enjoy as the tool does its thing, adding viewers to the stream as if by magic. ü™Ñ

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, just follow these steps:

```bash
