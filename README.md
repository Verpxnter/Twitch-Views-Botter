# Twitch-Views-Botter

Welcome to **Twitch-Views-Botter** — the ultimate tool for *magically* boosting the viewer count of your favorite Twitch streamer (yup, it works... somehow... lmao).
### Currently not working for Linux only Windows **(Cause Selenium is shittie 🐭)**

## 1. Introduction

**Twitch-Views-Botter** is a simple Python tool designed to boost the viewer count of a selected Twitch stream. Think of it as a little nudge to help your favorite streamer feel a bit more popular — or just to mess around and see how high you can go without Twitch noticing. 😂

## 2. Features

- **Boost Viewer Count**: Instantly adds viewers to the chosen Twitch stream.  
- **Proxy Power**: Leverages different proxy servers to simulate real viewers. (Pro tip: Only the first proxy server works reliably at the moment, so stick to it for now. The others are still "in training," lmao).
- **Multiple Tabs**: Opens multiple browser tabs to simulate a more "realistic" viewing experience.
- **Headless Operation**: Runs in a headless browser mode — because who wants to see all those tabs popping up anyway?

## 3. How It Works (Somehow)

1. **Select Your Proxy Server**: Choose from a list of proxy servers. (Reminder: Only the first one works properly right now, the rest are just there for show. 😂)
2. **Enter Your Streamer**: Input the Twitch username of your chosen streamer who you want to give that sweet view count boost.
3. **Set the Viewer Count**: Choose how many "viewers" you want to invite to the party. The main spot is usually between 10 and 25, though it might occasionally spike. Just keep in mind that the more viewers you add, the more unstable things can get. Use responsibly, or don’t — we’re not your parents. 🤷‍♂️ (And yes, it’s a bit of a wild ride, lmao)
4. **Troll with Views**: Sit back and watch as the tool works its magic, boosting the viewer count on the stream. Get ready for some hilarious reactions as your favorite streamer's chat goes wild trying to figure out where all these "viewers" are coming from. 🪄😂

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, just follow these steps:
